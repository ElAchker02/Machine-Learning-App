<b>Machine Learning Application.</b>

Project Overview
This Python-based application streamlines the machine learning workflow by allowing users to input datasets, select features, and designate target variables for prediction. 
It automatically determines the appropriate machine learning approach-regression, classification, or unsupervised learning-based on the nature of the target variable. Additionally, the application offers detailed statistical summaries and visualizations to aid in data understanding.

Features
- Automated Task Identification:
    - Continuous target variable: employs regression algorithms.
    - Discrete target variable: utilizes classification algorithms.
    - No target variable: applies unsupervised learning techniques.
- Data Visualization: Provides comprehensive statistical summaries and visual representations of the dataset.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies the process of feature selection and model application.
